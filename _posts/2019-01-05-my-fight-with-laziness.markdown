I got too many things that I needed to do, but I couldn't do them because of my annoying laziness. So I decided to list them here for public pressure. Also, I will add notes about their progress. This post is intended to continue till all these little things are done... 

- Sell unused electronics
- Withdraw all crypto money
- Read The Tipping Point and The Lean Startup
- Delete Facebook account
- Go to gym for 4 weeks consecutively
- Finish The Last of Us
- Finish Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain
- Prepare Dribbble invitation artwork
- Start DailyUI again
- Finish at least one book with Kindle
- Watch The Godfather Trilogy, Goodfellas, Scarface
- Watch 2001: A Space Odyssey
- Change home's decoration
- Learn to use Wacom Tablet
- **Reorder this list. ðŸ˜…**

Note #1: List is growing so reordering might help to prioritize tasks.
