I got too many things that I needed to do, but I couldn't do them because of my annoying laziness. So I decided to list them here for public pressure. Also, I will add notes about their progress. This post is intended to continue till all the little things are done... 

- Sell unused electronics
- Withdraw all crypto money
- Read The Tipping Point
- Delete Facebook account
- Go to gym for 4 weeks consecutively
- Finish The Last of Us
- Finish Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain
- Prepare Dribbble invitation artwork
- Start DailyUI again
