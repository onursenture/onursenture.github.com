![My Obsession](/../../images/fifa-19.jpg "FIFA 19")

I couldnâ€™t afford FIFA 19 this year. Normally it should be less than 100 TL at Black Friday but no it only dropped to 179 TL.

This is a serious issue. Seriousness level: 100/100

I have no other problems in my life. I tried so many other things but I couldn't find an alternative activity for boring Ankara nights.

Update (24 December): I bought it finally because it was allocating my brain's CPU usage at least 50%.
